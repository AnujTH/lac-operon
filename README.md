# lac-operon
This is a basic Lac Operon 'calculator' written in Java that I will continue to update.  An operon represents a set of genes regulated by a promoter. E. coli uses a 'lactose operon' for the regulation of lactose enzyme machinery through feedback loops. This calculator will allow the user to input either 'wild-type' or 'mutated' states for various genes and structures in the lac operon and will be able to see whether different enzymes are produced under the presence or absence of lactose.
